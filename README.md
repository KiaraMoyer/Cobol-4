# Cobol-4
This was a project done for a course at Hills. 
This project reads in a file containing the total amount of pop cans collected and will calculate the total amount of pop cans and the money made(depending on the state). 
It will then print out a record containing the data as well as the "winner" of the pop sales, otherwise it will print out an error report if any data is incorrect.
